## `mix()`

```tsx
const mix: (value: Animated.Adaptable<number>, x: Animated.Adaptable<number>, y: Animated.Adaptable<number>) => Animated.Node<number>;
```

`mix()` performs a linear interpolation between x and y using a to weight between them. The return value is computed as `x * (1 - value) + y * value`.

## `tween2d()`

```tsx
const tween2d: (value: Animated.Adaptable<number>, src: Transform2d, dst: Transform2d) => Transform2d;
```

`tween2d()` interpolates from any 2d transformation to any other 2d transformation.

```tsx
const src = [
  { rotateZ: Math.PI / 2}
  { scale: 0.5 }
];
const dst = [
  { skewX: Math.PI / 6 }
];
const progress = useLoop(1000);
const transform = tween2d(progress, src, dst);
return (
  <Animated.View style={{ transform }}>
    <Card type={Cards.Card1} />
  </Animated.View>
)
```

---

## `snapPoint()`

```tsx
const snapPoint: (value: Animated.Adaptable<number>, velocity: Animated.Adaptable<number>, points: Animated.Adaptable<number>[]) => Animated.Adaptable<number>;
```

Select a point based on a node value and its velocity.
